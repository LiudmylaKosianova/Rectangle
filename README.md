The task was to declare the rectangle structure and to write two functions - 
rectangle canonicalize (takes a rectangle, and "fixes" its representation 
by ensuring that the width and height are non-negative ), 
rectangle intersection (which takes two rectangles (r1, and r2), and returns 
the rectangle representing the intersection of the two.)
